Project Overview\nStandard emotion detection identifies \"Happy\" or \"Sad.\" But human intelligence is nuanced. A smirk is not just \"Happy\"; it is \"Happy + Contempt.\" This notebook builds a **Super-Intelligent Emotion Reader** that:\n1. Uses a pre-trained **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for state-of-the-art feature extraction.\n2. Implements a custom **\"Nuance Layer\"** to detect compound emotions.\n3. Provides a clean, modular inference pipeline ready for video deployment.\n\n### Tech Stack\n* **Core:** PyTorch, Timm (PyTorch Image Models)\n* **Architecture:** ViT-Base-Patch16-224 (Transfer Learning)\n* **Dataset:** FER-2013 (Facial Expression Recognition)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 🛠️ System Setup & Hyper-Tech Configuration\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset\nfrom torchvision import transforms, models\nimport timm  # PyTorch Image Models for State-of-the-Art architectures\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n\n# Set device to GPU (Standard for Deep Learning)\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nprint(f\"🚀 DaScient System Online.
